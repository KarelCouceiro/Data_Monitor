            "  Merge sorting is not a built-in function in Teradata, but it can be implemented using a combination of common table expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables. Here's an example of how you might implement a merge sort algorithm in Teradata:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Create a CTE to define the merge sort process:\n",

            "    SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, ..., t1.columnn\n",
            "    FROM table1 t1\n",

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to specify the order in which the rows should be sorted.\n",
