            "  Merge sorting is not a built-in function in Teradata, but it can be implemented using a combination of common table expressions (CTEs) and window functions. Here's an example of how you could implement a merge sort algorithm in Teradata:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Define a CTE to hold the left and right halves of the sorted data:\n",
            "```sql\n",
            "WITH LEFT_HALF AS (\n",
            "    SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'left_value'\n",
            "), RIGHT_HALVE AS (\n",
            "    SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'right_value'\n",
            ")\n",
            "SELECT * INTO SORTED_TABLE FROM LEFT_HALF\n",
            "MERGE JOIN RIGHT_HALVE ON LEFT_HALVE.COLUMN_NAME = RIGHT_HALVE.COLUMN_NAME;\n",
            "```\n",
            "In this example, `LEFT_HALF` and `RIGHT_HALVE` are CTEs that hold the left and right halves of the sorted data, respectively. The `MERGE JOIN` clause combines the two CTEs based on the specified column name, effectively merging the two halves into a single sorted table.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Implement the merge sort logic within the CTEs:\n",
            "```sql\n",
            "WITH LEFT_HALF AS (\n",
            "    SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'left_value'\n",
            "), RIGHT_HALVE AS (\n",
            "    SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'right_value'\n",
            ")\n",
            "SELECT * INTO SORTED_TABLE FROM LEFT_HALF\n",
            "ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME;\n",
            "\n",
            "IF ODD(COUNT(*) - 1) THEN\n",
            "    INSERT INTO RIGHT_HALVE (SELECT * FROM LEFT_HALVE ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME);\n",
            "    LEFT_HALVE = CONCAT('LEFT', LEFT_HALVE);\n",

            "END IF;\n",
            "```\n",
            "In this example, the `ODD` and `EVEN` functions are used to determine whether the number of rows in the current half is odd or even. If the number of rows is odd, the `INSERT` statement inserts the rows from the other half into the current half, and the `CONCAT` function concatenates the two halves into a single sorted table. If the number of rows is even, the process is repeated for the other half.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Repeat steps 1-2 until the desired level of sorting is achieved:\n",

            ")\n",
            "SELECT * INTO SORTED_TABLE FROM LEFT_HALVE\n",
            "ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME;\n",
            "\n",
            "IF ODD(COUNT(*) - 1) THEN\n",
            "    INSERT INTO RIGHT_HALVE (SELECT * FROM LEFT_HALVE ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME);\n",
            "    LEFT_HALVE = CONCAT('LEFT', LEFT_HALVE);\n",
            "ELSE IF EVEN(COUNT(*) - 1) THEN\n",

            "END IF;\n",
            "\n",
            "REPEAT UNTIL COUNT(*) = 0;\n",
            "```\n",
            "In this example, the process is repeated until the desired level of sorting is achieved, as indicated by the `UNTIL` clause. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to check whether there are any remaining rows to sort.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note that this implementation assumes that the `COLUMN_NAME` value is constant for all rows in the table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the CTEs and merge join clause accordingly. Additionally, this implementation does not handle edge cases such as an empty left or right half, which may require additional logic to handle correctly.\n"
